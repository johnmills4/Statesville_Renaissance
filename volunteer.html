	<h1>Why you should volunteer for the Renaissance Foundation</h1>
	<p>The Statesville High School Renaissance Foundation is a nonprofit school based program.
	Statesville High Schools is the only school in Iredell County with this organization.
	As a volunteer you are able to support the staff, reward students for academic excellence,
	and good behavior. It is also a great way to be involved with your high school student
    and get to know the teachers.
